A little rock-paper-scissor mini-game on GO LANGAGE
----
## 1) Credits :
This mini-game was inspired by this repository :
-   https://github.com/deeheber/rock-paper-scissors

> I won't be able to do this without her help ! Thank's to Deeheber
------------
## 2) Why this ?
I decide to make my own rock / paper / scissors version by myself on my way trying to learn and developp on GO Langage.
And yes, I do use some ressource
> See : 1) Credits

------------
## 3) How to start the mini game ?
 Simply use the main.exe file, and all instructions will be there !

------------
## 4) What's coming next to this repository ?
### I will try to improve this little minigame, such as much colorful line to be more enjoyable.
__For exemple__ :
1) The 3 situations cases :
- `#ff0000` Red for defeat
- `#ffff00` Yellow for Tie
- `#00ff00` Green for Win

2) Build a PVP or PVE (depends on the user)

3) Maybe, make an integration online using HTML / CSS / GO
